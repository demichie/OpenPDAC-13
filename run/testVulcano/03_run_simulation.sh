# Script 3: Main Simulation Run
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This script executes the main simulation.
# It assumes that the mesh and fields have been prepared by the previous scripts.
#
# It performs these steps:
#   - Swaps in the '.run' dictionaries for the main simulation.
#   - Runs the solver in parallel.
#   - Reconstructs the results for final visualization.
#
# Usage: ./03_run_simulation.sh
# =============================================================================

# Change to the script's directory for robust execution
cd "${0%/*}" || exit 1

# Source the OpenFOAM functions for running applications
. "$WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/tools/RunFunctions"
